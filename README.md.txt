***Design A Bridge Beam***

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

This terminal application calculates the adequacy of a structural bridge beam. It takes user inputs for span length, load type and beam size. It returns an assessment of whether or not the beam is adequate. If the beam is not adequate, the user is presented with options to change the span, beam size or loading.

This is built for structural engineers to assist in selecting an initial beam size for their simply supported bridge design. The engineer will interact with the program by refining their inputs for span, beam-type and load-type until the capacity is the proposed beam is adequate to support the given load.

The application works by comparing the bending capacity of a selected beam to the bending action induced by the load for the given span.

## Development Plan

### Features

#### Include self-weight?

The self weight feature asks the user whether or not they would like to include the self-weight of the beam in the capacity assessment. If yes, the self-weight of the beam is
